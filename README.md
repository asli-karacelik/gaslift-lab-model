The developed mathematical model is for gas lift laboratory studies, which can be modified to employ it for industrial applications.  

The files are named according to the researchers who conducted the related experimental study. 

In the files:
  - The research papers containing the experimental data are in PDF files. 
  - The extracted experimental data are in CSV files. The data was obtained from the research papers using PlotDigitizer version 3.1.5. 
  - S indicates the submergence ratio in the file titles. For example, S_0_442_* signifies that the submergence ratio is 0.442.
  - The main code is in the *_main_code.m files. Running this code will generate all the graphs for both experimental and theoretical studies. 
  - *_model_function.m files contain the proposed mathematical model. 
  - *_parameter_function.m files contains all the necessary parameters.
