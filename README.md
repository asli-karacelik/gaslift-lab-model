In the files:
  - The extracted experimental data are in CSV files. The data was obtained from the research papers using PlotDigitizer version 3.1.5. 
  - S indicates the submergence ratio in the file titles. For example, S_0_442_* signifies that the submergence ratio is 0.442.
  - The main code is in the main_*.m files. Running this code will generate all the graphs for both experimental and theoretical studies. 
  - function_model_*.m files contain the proposed mathematical model. 
  - function_parameter_*.m files contain all the necessary parameters.
